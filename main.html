	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It is an essential concept for developing efficient code, allowing developers to evaluate and optimize the speed of their programs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. This concept is important for understanding how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
